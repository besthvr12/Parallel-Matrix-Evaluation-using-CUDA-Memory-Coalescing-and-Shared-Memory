# Efficient Matrix Computation with Memory Optimization

Welcome to the Efficient Matrix Computation project! This endeavor delves into the world of matrix manipulation, where we tackle the task of efficiently calculating the matrix E through the equation:

E = AB + CDT (1)

## Problem Statement

Consider four integer matrices: Ap√óq, Bq√ór, Cp√óq, and Dr√óq. Our challenge lies in devising an optimized solution that elegantly computes matrix E while prioritizing memory coalescing and shared memory utilization.

## Approach and Optimization

üéØ **Memory Coalescing**: Our solution takes a strategic approach to memory access, ensuring data elements are efficiently fetched, maximizing performance in the matrix computation.

üîó **Shared Memory Magic**: We leverage the power of shared memory, facilitating seamless communication and data sharing among threads to accelerate the matrix calculation process.

## Implementation

1. Initialize matrices Ap√óq, Bq√ór, Cp√óq, and Dr√óq with relevant integer values.

2. Employ memory optimization strategies to calculate the matrix E according to the equation E = AB + CDT.

3. Observe the magic of efficient memory coalescing and shared memory utilization in action.

## Insights and Impact
